# GithubPedia
This is a full wiki project made to feature many things.. and stuffs.. that can be found on GitHub.

## How to add a page
To add a page, append a new line in the `pages` file with contents formatted like this:

    Page Name		pagename
Enter the page name, then a couple of tabs followed by a in-code name for this new page.  
After that, add a new file in the `wiki` directory.  
The name must be the same as the second column you've put in the `pages` file followed by `.md`.
This new file is a strict-Markdown file. Strict-Markdown means that whitespace is required in some areas of the file.

## Difference between Markdown and Strict-Markdown
In Strict-Markdown:
* When creating a header, a space character is required after `#`.
* An empty line is required after a header
